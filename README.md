# 🍜 Zomato Restaurant Data Analysis (Colab)

## Project Overview

This repository contains an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** of Zomato restaurant data, performed in a Google Colab environment.
The primary goal is to identify key factors influencing operational choices (online ordering, table booking) and 
customer engagement (ratings and votes) to inform market strategy.

--------

The analysis is documented in the `Zomato.ipynb` notebook, with core findings summarized in the accompanying presentation.

## 🔑 Key Findings

--------

Based on the visualizations and analysis (detailed in the `Zomato Restaurant Data Analysis.pptx`):

1.  **Dominant Market:** The Zomato platform's primary market is characterized by **Dining** establishments,
which also receive the highest volume of **total customer votes**.
2.  **Service Quality vs. Channel:** The analysis compared average ratings between restaurants that offer
 **online orders** and those that do not, providing insights into service execution across different delivery models.
3.  **Operational Strategy:** The project mapped the adoption of services like **online ordering** and **table booking**
 to understand common operational strategies within the dataset.
